# Hi, welcome to my github profile :wave:

![Bike image](https://github.com/morawer/morawer/blob/main/bici.jpg?raw=true)

My name is Daniel Morala, and I'm a big enthusiast of new technologies. I work in the quality department at a factory where I strive to enhance quality and inspection processes. I thoroughly enjoy improving productivity and creating integrations with Notion and Python for these processes. Additionally, I'm in the process of learning and practicing web development.

I have a keen interest in mountain biking (I ride every week), coding, and new technologies that enhance people's lives and automate complex processes.

Thank you very much for visiting my profile. Comments and suggestions are always welcome. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::v:
